How to C# Socket programming
C# simplifies the network programming through its namespaces like System.Net and System.Net.Sockets . A Socket is an End-Point of To and From (Bidirectional) communication link between two programs (Server Program and Client Program ) running on the same network . We need two programs for communicating a socket application in C#. A Server Socket Program ( Server ) and a Client Socket Program ( Client ) .

C# socket example:
========
C# Server Socket Program: 

A C# Server Socket Program running on a computer has a socket that bound 
to a Port Number on the same computer and listening to the client's incoming requests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
C# Client Socket Program: 

A C# Client Socket Program have to know the IP Address ( Hostname ) 
of the computer that the C# Server Socket Program resides and the Port Number assign for listening
for client's request ..

>>There are two types of communication protocol uses for Socket Programming in C# , they are 
    TCP/IP ( Transmission Control Protocol/Internet protocol ) Communication and UDP/IP ( User Datagram Protocol/Internet protocol ) Communication .
==========================================================================
>Domain Name Service (DNS)
>There are some other helper classes like IPEndPoint, IPADdress, SocketException etc, which we can use for Network programming

>Multiple n/w cards called  "inteface"
==========================
>wireless  card
>Ethernt adapter
>VPN

=============
common ports are :
==============
common ports:
--------
1.21 FTP(file transfer protocol)

2.22 SSH(secure shell )

3.23 TelNet

4.25 SMTP(simple mail transfer protocol)

5.80 HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol)

6.110 POP3(post office  protocol)

==================
DNS:
====
..Domain Name service
>Translates human-readabble into IP  Address.
>Relieves burden of  memorization.
>This is what  many application use
