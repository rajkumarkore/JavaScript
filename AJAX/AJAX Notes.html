AJAX:   is a developer's dream, because you can:
 ====
Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background

>AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page

What is XML?
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language much like HTML
XML was designed to store and transport data
XML was designed to be self-descriptive
XML is a W3C Recommendation


>Asynchronous  JS and XML
>set of web technologies
>send  and receive data  asynchronously
>Does not interfere  with current web page
>JSON  has  replaced XML  for the most part


>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API that can be used by JavaScript, JScript, VBScript, and other web browser scripting languages to transfer and manipulate XML data to and from a webserver using HTTP, establishing an independent connection channel between a webpage's Client-Side and Server-Side.


>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

>JavaScript variables are not mutable. Only JavaScript objects.
