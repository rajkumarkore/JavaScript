Delegates: it is a type safe function parameter.
=======
-->A  delegate  holds the reference of a method  and then  calls the method for execution

What is a delegate ?
==============
>It is a reference type.
>It is a function pointer or it holds a reference (pointer) to a function (method).
>It is type safe.
>Delegates are mainly used for the event handling and the callback methods.

>to call a method by using a delegate we have 3 steps:
--------------------------------------------------
1.define a delegate.
[<modifiers>] delegate void/type  <Name>([<parameter list>]



There are three types of delegates that can be used in C#.
--------------------------------------------------------
>Single Delegate.--->to ref or repesent in one funcn 
>Multicast Delegate. ...>to ref or repesent in  more then one funcn 
>Generic Delegate.
      >Func
     >Action
    >Predicate



What is the use of delegates in C#?
==================
Delegates are objects that contain information about the function rather 
than data. We can encapsulate a reference to the method inside the delegate 
object. They are similar to function pointers in C and C++ but the difference between delegates and 
function pointers is that delegates are type safe

>>Lambda  Expression:
=================
* A lambda expression is an anonymous function that you can use to create delegates or expression tree types. By using lambda expressions, 
you can write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the value of function calls. ... 
A lambda expression is the most convenient way to create that delegate.


Predicate delegate:
============
>Predicate delegate takes one input parameter and boolean return type.
>Predicate delegate must contains some criateria to check whether supplied parameter meets those criateria or not.
>Anonymous method and Lambda expression can be assigned to the predicate delegate.
====================================================

>Func, Action and Predicate are generic inbuilt delegates present in System namespace.
>All three can be used with method, anonymous method and lambda expression.
>Func can contains 0 to 16 input parameters and must have one return type.
>Action can contain 1 to 16 input parameters and does not have any return type.
>Predicate delegate should satisfy some criteria of method and must have one input parameter and one Boolean return type either true or false.
>Input parameters of custom delegates is fixed but Func and Actions input parameter is variable from 0 to 16 and 1 to 16 respectively.
